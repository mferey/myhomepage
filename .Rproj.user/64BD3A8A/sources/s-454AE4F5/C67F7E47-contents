I received my Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania’s <a href="https://www.ese.upenn.edu" target="_blank">Electrical and Systems Engineering (ESE) Department</a> in December 2023. Additionally, I earned a Master’s degree in Statistics from <a href="https://www.wharton.upenn.edu" target="_blank">The Wharton School</a>, University of Pennsylvania, in December 2021. Before joining Penn, I obtained an M.Sc. degree in Pure Mathematics and two B.Sc. degrees in Pure Mathematics and Electrical Engineering, all from the <a href="http://www.en.sharif.edu" target="_blank">Sharif University of Technology</a> in Tehran, Iran.

I am deeply passionate about mathematics and have dedicated my academic journey to its pursuit. Throughout my undergraduate and graduate studies, I had the opportunity to engage in a wide array of mathematical disciplines, both through coursework and self-study, reaching advanced levels in various areas. These include but are not limited to:

- Graph Theory
- Number Theory
- Combinatorics
- Topology
- Abstract Algebra: Group, Ring, Field, Module, and Galois Theory
- Operator Theory and Linear Algebra
- Probability and Measure Theory
- Manifolds and Differential Geometry
- Fourier, Complex, Mathematical, and Functional Analysis
- Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations
- Logic, Set Theory, and Foundations of Mathematics
- Mathematical Statistics and Statistical Inference
- Mathematical Optimization
- Information and Coding Theory

Initially drawn to pursuing a Ph.D. in pure mathematics, I recognized a significant disparity between theoretical advancements and practical needs in fields like machine learning. Motivated to bridge this gap, I shifted my focus towards applied areas of mathematics, aiming to connect theoretical concepts with real-world problems. This transition led me to explore diverse fields such as Communications, Coding and Information Theory, Optimization, Network Privacy, Artificial Intelligence, Graph Neural Networks, Finance, and Economical Models where I made meaningful contributions.
